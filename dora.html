		<h1 style="text-align: center;">THE ADVENTURES OF DORA</h1>	
		<p>   Dora was walking along a path in the big dangerous mountains which no one dared cross but dora was too power full and didn't give a shit. Her intention of being there was unknown but legends say she's looking for something, or someone. 
		</p>
        <p>   She kept on walking until she found herself in front of a dead end. Dora stood and thought even though that was something she didn't usually do. But this time, she had to find another way, so she had no choice but to use her mind (which is rumoured to be stolen). Eventually, she couldn't think of any good idea so she just threw herself off the nearest cliff. Now, anyone else would've died, but dora was different. She trusted the mountain and let the wind take her to wherever she needs to be. 
</p>
<p>   Dora slammed the ground upon landing and looked up, she was in the middle of nowhere. There were no paths, no trees, nothing other than dirt. Dora felt hungry so she ate some of the dirt then continued her journey. She looked around full degree, and finally noticed something in the distance. On the edge of the rocky mountain, there was a waterfall. Dora ran full speed on all fours towards it so she could drink water; but she tripped and rolled towards it aggressively until she fell in it. Thankfully, she knew how to swim at least. But the moment she opened her eyes, she realized there was a cave hidden behind the waterfall. It was dark and scary and unclear whether occupied or not. Dora, being Dora, didn't give a shit and walked into there like an npc. Maybe in this cave she'll find what she's looking for.</p>
<p>   As she got deeper and deeper inside the cave, it only got darker, and the faint noise of breathing only got louder. Dora still didn't give a shit and just kept walking forwards. She did notice the breathing however, so she pulled out her sword and was swinging it everywhere. She heard a growl behind her, and turned around to see a pair of huge glowing green eyes staring back at her. It was hard to see in the dark, but the owner of those eyes was clearly huge and clearly unhappy. Dora said some npc dialogue before lunging into the dragon and attacking it, despite being the intruder of its home. The dragon ate dora and she died. For a moment. Unfortunately she resurrected and kept swinging back at the dragon until the dragon got sick of her and stopped, hoping she would leave eventually. Dora had other plans in mind, she was bored and wanted to annoy the dragon so she just sat and talked with it about her adventures with someone called hamood habibi and the stories of santa claus and ded moroz. The dragon didn't give a fuck what she was talking about and was just trying to sleep. Until, he heard the name Ivan. Dora brought up her backstory and started talking shit about that certain person. As it turns out, Dora was looking for her stolen dick. Which she stole by the way. She stole it from some random person named islam and thought nothing would happen, but little did she know... islam was the twin brother of ivan, the infamous dicks thief and assassin. Islam told his brother and they went after her, taking back what's theirs. Now, they only got back what belonged to them and it was completely fair and finished. But not to Dora, she would not stop until she found the twin brothers, and took back the dick she stole. </p>
<p>   The dragon could not care less about dora's backstory, but he himself had history with ivan. Ivan was his number one enemy. The worst of all. He was seemingly just some weak, bitch boy, but whenever the dragon would hang out with his princess friends ivan would show up out of no where and beat the shit of the dragon, taking away his dick too. The dragon watched Ivan go back to the village and say that he defeated the dragon and saved the princesses from him, and everyone in the kingdom would call him a hero. But in the mountains, everyone hated Ivan. Even the infamous wizard, hamood habibi. The dragon especially always planned for a way to get revenge on him, but he never knew when. He needed to be ready. Now, Dora looked dumb as hell but he thought, maybe since they both have the same goals, they could both try to fight off ivan together. Dora never dies anyways, so it's definitely a bonus. The dragon and Dora shake hands and agree to kill Ivan, take away his dick and split it in half between them, then never interact with each other again. Dora gets on the dragons back and they fly away, on their hunt for Ivan. And his dick.</p>
